Chess Game Final Project:
Consists of a generated chess board with coordinate layout using tkinter
Each side will have a class with sub classes for pieces
Calculations will have to be made for each classâ€™s possible movement
Bot will think up to 4 moves ahead looking at every move possibility and taking the path that results in the most possible points (based on piece captures)
