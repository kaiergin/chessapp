Chess Game Final Project:
Consists of a generated chess board with coordinate layout using tkinter
Each side will have a class with sub classes for pieces
Calculations will have to be made for each class’s possible movement
Bot will think up to 4 moves ahead looking at every move possibility and taking the path that results in the most possible points (based on piece captures)

Update: Chess game movement complete. Pieces still don’t have chess logic and do not understand player turns. Hopefully will add in turns and some of chess logic before end of class.

Update 1/13/2016: Turns added

Update 1/15/2016: Chess logic started. Basic frame added. Working for pawns but does not recognize when a piece jumps over another piece. Will fix soon.
